                <h3>Philae Temple Tour</h3>
                <p>A Philae Temple tour involves a boat trip to the temple's island location, where you can explore the
                    well-preserved Temple of Isis, dedicated to the goddess Isis and her family, and experience the
                    Philae Sound and Light Show in the evening. Tours typically last for a few hours and often include a
                    knowledgeable guide to explain the temple's history and mythology, which is steeped in stories of
                    Isis resurrecting Osiris.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="tour">
                <h3>Abu Simbel Excursion</h3>
                <p>An Abu Simbel excursion is a tour to the magnificent ancient temples of Ramses II and Nefertari in
                    southern Egypt, typically a day trip from Aswan, either by road or by flight for a faster but more
                    expensive option from Cairo. These day tours involve early morning departures, a 3-4 hour journey to
                    the temples, exploring the colossal statues and intricate carvings, and then returning to Aswan</p>

            <div class="tour">
                <h3>High Dam & Unfinished Obelisk Tour</h3>
                <p>A "High Dam and Unfinished Obelisk" tour is a private excursion from Aswan that combines a look at
                    modern engineering at the Aswan High Dam with a visit to an ancient quarry site to see the giant
                    Unfinished Obelisk. The High Dam tour shows how the dam was built to control the Nile and generate
                    power, while the Unfinished Obelisk explains how ancient Egyptians carved large obelisks from the
                    rock, detailing the discovery of a crack in this massive stone that led to its abandonment.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="tour">
                <h3>Nubian Village Tour</h3>
                <p>the Nubian Village in Aswan is generally considered worth visiting for its unique, colorful
                    architecture, cultural immersion, and vibrant local atmosphere. Visitors can enjoy a scenic boat
                    ride to reach the village, explore its vibrant streets, interact with local residents, purchase
                    handmade crafts, and experience traditional Nubian hospitality by sampling local food and drinks
                    like hibiscus tea. While some feel the experience might be a bit short or not worth the price, many
                    find a few hours or a full day provides a beautiful and interesting cultural contrast to the ancient
                    sites in the area.</p>
