                <h3>Snorkeling & Diving</h3>
                <p>Hurghada offers incredible snorkeling and scuba diving in the warm, clear waters of the Red Sea,
                    known for its vibrant coral reefs and diverse marine life like colorful fish and even dolphins.
                    Snorkeling is an accessible activity for all ages, focusing on shallow reefs from the surface using
                    a mask, snorkel, and fins. Scuba diving allows for deeper exploration, requiring training and
                    equipment, and provides access to sunken wrecks and a more profound underwater experience. Visitors
                    can enjoy both with guided boat trips, with options ranging from beginner-friendly Discover Scuba
                    Diving courses to full Open Water certifications for certified divers.</p>
