        <h1>Luxor Tours</h1>
        <p>Known as the world’s greatest open-air museum, Luxor is rich in temples, tombs, and ancient history.</p>

                <h3>Valley of the Kings Tour</h3>
                <p>A "Valley of the Kings tour" involves visiting the ancient necropolis on Luxor's West Bank, often
                    including a licensed Egyptologist guide, air-conditioned transport, and entry to three tombs. While
                    tours are widely available from cities like Luxor and Hurghada, you can also arrange a private car
                    or taxi to explore independently. A general admission ticket provides access to three of the
                    approximately 10 available tombs, which rotate regularly.</p>

            <div class="tour">
                <h3>Karnak Temple Tour</h3>
                <p>A Karnak Temple tour involves exploring the massive Karnak Temple Complex, often paired with a Luxor
                    Temple tour and potentially a visit to other East or West Bank sites like the Valley of the Kings.
                    Tours typically include a knowledgeable Egyptologist guide and can range from half-day private
                    excursions to full-day packages, with highlights including the Great Hypostyle Hall, the Sacred
                    Lake, and the Avenue of Sphinxes. To avoid large crowds, consider visiting early in the morning.</p>

                <h3>Luxor Temple Tour</h3>
                <p>Luxor Temple was a major religious center in Thebes, which was once the capital of Ancient Egypt.
                    Amenhotep III, Ramses II, Tutankhamun, and other pharaohs added new buildings to the complex over
                    hundreds of years, contributing to its sprawling scale. Luxor Temple was known as “the place of the
                    First Occasion,” where the god Amon was reborn during the pharaoh’s annual coronation reenactment.
                    The thousands of sandstone fragments scattered across Luxor Temple contain hieroglyphic texts and
                    paintings of temple rituals, offering invaluable insight into the ancient past.

                    Today, remains of this vast complex include the colossal Great Colonnade Hall, which is almost 61
                    meters (200 feet) long and features 28 columns measuring six meters (21 feet). Luxor Temple is also
                    famous for its carvings of festival scenes, which were largely completed around 1330 BCE during the
                    reign of Tutankhamun.

                    Together with other ancient sites in Thebes, Luxor Temple is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site
                    for its outstanding universal value. </p>

                <h3>Hot Air Balloon Ride</h3>
                <p>Luxor’s air balloon is the most magnificent wild adventure Luxor’s visitors can have. It’s an air
                    balloon that’s a 45-minute ride and fits a number of 12 to 34 people. You can feel the original
                    vibes of wildness rush through your system is around 2,000 feet above the ground level. You might
                    have explored Luxor on land, but an air balloon trip guarantees you a historic trip that’s more
                    thrilling, as you’ll behold every center of the ancient Egyptian history, from Hatshepsut Temple to
                    Luxor Temple floating in the air.</p>
