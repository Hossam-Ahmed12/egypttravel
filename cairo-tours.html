                <h3>Pyramids & Sphinx Tour</h3>
                <p>A "Pyramids & Sphinx Tour" is a guided excursion to the Giza Plateau in Egypt, a popular destination
                    featuring the ancient Pyramids of Giza (Cheops, Khafre, and Menkaure) and the Great Sphinx. These
                    tours typically include an air-conditioned vehicle for transportation, a professional Egyptologist
                    guide, and hotel pick-up/drop-off.</p>

                <h3>Egyptian Museum Tour</h3>
                <p>An "Egyptian Museum Tour" can refer to a tour of the Egyptian Museum (also known as the Egyptian
                    Museum in Cairo) or the Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM), both in Giza/Cairo, each offering unique
                    experiences. The Egyptian Museum in Cairo is the oldest archaeological museum in the Middle East,
                    housing over 170,000 artifacts from prehistory to the Graeco-Roman era, with its most famous display
                    being the King Tutankhamun collection. The GEM is a newer, technologically advanced museum designed
                    to house more than 100,000 artifacts, including the complete King Tutankhamun collection, displayed
                    for the first time together in one place</p>

                <h3>Islamic & Coptic Cairo Tour</h3>
                <p>An Islamic & Coptic Cairo Tour visits both ancient religious sites in Egypt's capital, starting with
                    Islamic landmarks like the Salah al-Din Citadel and the Mosque of Muhammad Ali, then exploring
                    Coptic sites such as the Hanging Church and the Saints Sergius and Bacchus Church, often concluding
                    at the vibrant Khan el-Khalili Bazaar. Most tours provide a private vehicle and guide, hotel
                    pickup/drop-off, and may include lunch and admission fees depending on the package, though this is
                    often an optional upgrade.</p>

                <h3>Khan El Khalili Bazaar</h3>
                <p>Khan el-Khalili is a vast, historic open-air bazaar in the heart of Cairo's Islamic district, dating
                    back to the 14th century. This labyrinthine market features a colorful array of shops selling
                    everything from local handicrafts, jewelry, and spices to souvenirs and modern goods, alongside
                    traditional cafes, ancient architecture, and bustling workshops. The bazaar offers a vibrant, if
                    sometimes overwhelming, cultural experience, allowing visitors to explore authentic Egyptian life
                    and find unique treasures amidst the noise and activity.</p>
