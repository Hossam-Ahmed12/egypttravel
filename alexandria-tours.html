                <h3>Catacombs of Kom El Shoqafa</h3>
                <p>The Catacombs of Kom El Shoqafa, discovered accidentally in 1900, are Alexandria's largest Roman
                    burial site, dating to the 2nd century AD. This necropolis is a remarkable fusion of Egyptian,
                    Greek, and Roman cultures, featuring a unique blend of architectural styles and artistic motifs
                    within its three subterranean levels. Key features include a spiral staircase, a rotunda with a
                    central well, a Roman-style triclinium (banqueting hall), and numerous tomb chambers with burial
                    niches (luculi) and intricate carvings</p>

                <h3>Qaitbay Citadel</h3>
                <p>Qaitbay Citadel is a 15th-century Mamluk fortress in Alexandria, Egypt, built by Sultan Al-Ashraf
                    Sayf al-Din Qaitbay between 1477 and 1479 AD. Strategically located on the site of the ancient
                    Pharos Lighthouse, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, the citadel served as a crucial
                    defense against naval attacks and protected Alexandria's port. The square-shaped, multi-towered
                    structure incorporates elements of the original lighthouse's ruins and includes internal chambers
                    for soldiers, a mosque, and a prominent throne room.</p>

                <h3>Roman Amphitheatre</h3>
                <p>A Roman amphitheatre was a large, freestanding, oval-shaped, open-air structure with tiered seating
                    surrounding a central arena, designed for public spectacles like gladiatorial combats, animal hunts,
                    and public executions. The architectural design, pioneered in ancient Rome, emphasized visibility of
                    the action over acoustics, with iconic examples including the Colosseum in Rome. These structures
                    served as central points of Roman society, demonstrating Roman engineering and power through
                    spectacular events, and many are still used today for modern cultural events.</p>

                <h3>Bibliotheca Alexandrina</h3>
                <p>The Bibliotheca Alexandrina (BA) is a modern library and cultural center in Alexandria, Egypt, built
                    to revive the spirit of the ancient Library of Alexandria, a legendary institution of learning in
                    antiquity. This striking circular building houses a massive Main Library, specialized libraries,
                    several museums, a planetarium, and hosts numerous cultural and scientific activities. Its mission
                    is to promote dialogue, understanding, and the production and dissemination of knowledge, acting as
                    a global link for researchers and a window between Egypt and the world</p>
